{"name":"Retina","tagline":"CSS processor which adds retina declarations where retina version images are found, generates scaled down non-retina images and updates the existing stylesheet","body":"[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/unfold/retina.png)](http://travis-ci.org/unfold/retina)\r\n\r\n### Retina\r\n\r\nRetina analyzes your existing CSS files and generates missing non-retina resolution \r\nimages by resizing their retina resolution counterpart. The result is an updated \r\nCSS stylesheet complete with media queries.\r\n\r\nThis means you'll be able to author your CSS files as if you were only working with\r\nstandard resolution images.\r\n\r\n#### No strings attached\r\n\r\nInstead of relying on a specific [framework](http://compass-style.org) or \r\n[build system](http://gruntjs.com) Retina will work with anything that outputs a CSS file.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n    $ npm install retina\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n    $ retina [options] [file]\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n    -t, --target <path>   target path relative to input\r\n    -s, --source <path>   source path relative to input (required when stdin is used)\r\n    -h, --help            output usage information\r\n    -V, --version         output the version number\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n#### Generating downscaled images and updating rules of an existing CSS file:\r\n\r\n    $ retina -t images/scaled main.css > main.scaled.css\r\n\r\n#### Using Retina with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com):\r\n\r\n    $ sass css/main.scss | retina --source css --target images/scaled > main.css\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Simen Brekken &lt;simen@unfold.no&gt;\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n","google":"UA-21248447-16","note":"Don't delete this file!
